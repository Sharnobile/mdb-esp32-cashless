# VMflow iOS App

Native iOS companion app for vending machine operators. Built with SwiftUI, targeting iOS 17+.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — KPI cards (revenue, sales, machine status, stock alerts), 30-day sales chart, recent sales feed
- **Machine Management** — Machines sorted by stock urgency with detailed stats cards:
  - Sales stats: today, yesterday, this week, last week (revenue + count)
  - Summary badges: Empty, Low, Swap Needed, No Stock counts
  - Product deficit rows with warehouse availability labels (In Stock / Swap / No Stock)
  - Discontinued product (DC) badges
  - Overall stock percentage bar
- **Tray Configuration** — Full CRUD for machine tray slots:
  - Add single tray or batch-add sequential slots
  - Edit slot number, product, capacity, stock, thresholds
  - Quick stock adjustments (+/- buttons)
  - Stock bar with min stock (amber) and fill-when-below (blue) threshold markers
  - Fuzzy product search picker
- **Refill Wizard** — Multi-step guided refill tour optimized for one-handed field use:
  - **Packing step** — Product-centric view: products grouped across machines, per-machine checkboxes, quantity steppers
  - Warehouse stock awareness: tracks available stock, shows partial/out-of-stock states
  - **Machine selection** — Pick which machines to refill, ordered by proximity or urgency
  - **Refill step** — Per-machine tray adjustments, fill-to-capacity, warehouse stock deduction
  - **Review step** — Summary of all changes before committing
  - **Summary** — Tour stats with items refilled, machines completed
- **Push Notifications** — APNs support for low-stock alerts and other events

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15+ (iOS 17 SDK)
- A running VMflow backend (Supabase + MQTT via Docker or Supabase CLI)

### Steps

1. Open `ios/VMflow/` in Xcode (File > Open > select the folder containing `Package.swift`)
2. The Supabase Swift SDK is included as a Swift Package dependency:
   - `https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift` (from: 2.0.0)
3. Configure your Supabase credentials in `Resources/Info.plist`:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` — Your Supabase API URL (e.g., `http://10.0.1.181:8000` for Docker, `http://10.0.1.181:54321` for CLI)
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Your Supabase anonymous key
4. Build and run on a simulator or device

> **Important**: Use your Mac's LAN IP (not `localhost`) so physical devices and simulators can reach the backend.

### Environment Variables (Info.plist)

| Key | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase API gateway URL | `http://10.0.1.181:8000` |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous (public) key | `eyJ...` |

### Push Notifications (APNs)

To enable push notifications, configure these in the backend `Docker/.env`:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `APNS_KEY_ID` | Your APNs key ID (from Apple Developer portal) |
| `APNS_TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer Team ID |
| `APNS_TOPIC` | App bundle identifier (e.g., `xyz.vmflow.app`) |
| `APNS_KEY_P8` | APNs private key (PEM format, multi-line in quotes) |
| `APNS_PRODUCTION` | `true` for TestFlight/App Store, `false` for debug builds |

## Architecture

- **MVVM** pattern with SwiftUI + Combine
- **Swift Concurrency** (async/await) for all network calls
- **Supabase Swift SDK** for auth, database queries, and storage
- **Swift Charts** framework for revenue visualization

### Structure

```
ios/VMflow/

    Trays/                     — Tray list, TrayEditSheet, TrayRow with quick actions
    Refill/                    — Wizard: PackingStepView, RefillStepView, ReviewStepView, SummaryView
    Components/                — StatusBadge, StockBar (with threshold markers),
                                 ProductImage, KPICard, StockHealthIndicator,
                                 BottomTabBar, FlowLayout
  Resources/
    Info.plist                 — App config with Supabase credentials
```

## Data Flow

1. `AuthService` manages session state and organization membership
2. On successful login, the app fetches the user's organization via `get-my-organization` edge function
3. ViewModels query Supabase tables directly using the Swift SDK (`from().select().execute()`)
4. Product images load from Supabase Storage (`product-images` bucket) via `AsyncImage`
5. All prices are in EUR (not cents), matching the backend schema
6. Warehouse stock is fetched from `warehouse_stock_batches` to classify product availability
7. Sales are grouped into time periods (today, yesterday, this week, last week) using Monday-based week boundaries

## Parity with Web Dashboard

The iOS app mirrors key features from the Nuxt web dashboard:

| Feature | Web | iOS |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Machine cards with sales stats | 4 time periods | 4 time periods (2x2 grid) |
| Stock urgency badges | Empty, Low, Swap, No Stock | Same badges |
| Warehouse availability labels | In Stock / Swap / No Stock | Same labels + dimming |
| Stock bar threshold markers | min stock + fill-when-below | Amber + blue markers |
| Discontinued product badge | DC tag | DC capsule |
| Product-centric packing | Combined mode | Same layout |
| Fuzzy product search | Combobox | Picker with fuzzy match |
