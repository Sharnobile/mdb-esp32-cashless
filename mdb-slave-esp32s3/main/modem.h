 * poorly (modem ends up in an undefined RAT/CFUN/CGATT combination).
 *
 * Field symptom (captured 2026-04-28 in initial provisioning):
 *   - watchdog Layer-2 hard-reset starts at t=263s (3x AT timeouts)
 *   - lwIP fires PPP_LOST_IP at t=304s (LCP echo died ~150s ago)
 *   - ppp_reconnect_task spawns and calls modem_disconnect on a modem
 *     that watchdog is mid-init'ing — both run concurrently, modem is
 *     left wedged for 90+ s before either completes
 *
 * Callers that drive a multi-step recovery (cellular_bring_up_task,
 * ppp_reconnect_task, the watchdog) MUST wrap their entire flow in
 * modem_op_lock/unlock. The mutex is recursive (same task can take it
 * multiple times). Hold time can be tens of seconds; do not call from
